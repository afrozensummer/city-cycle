# city-cycle

Code: Relevant files include index.html, vis.html, averageDayVis.js, slider.js, station_line_chart.js, and bikelinechart.js. All these files are accessible via our public github account: https://github.com/afrozensummer/city-cycle. We used very minimal prewritten functionality including date parsing into more usable forms, but we wrote all the code in each of these files ourselves. 

Screencase: Please see a screencast of our visualization here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpVh8tfLZI&feature=youtu.be

Features and How To Use: 
When you load the main page, either click 'Read Our Story' or scroll down to read more about our project. The 'Why Citibike' page includes the motivation behind our project, and the 'What We Found' page below includes four interesting findings from our visualization. 

To get to the main visualization, click the 'Launch Visualization' button from the home page. If you are on one of the read pages, navigate to the top of the page via the left side bar or just scroll up. Click 'Launch Visualization'

Select a day from the buttons on the top and press play to start the visualization. You can click pause to stop at any moment in time or drag the bike along the time line to jump to any point during the day. The line chart above the timeline displays the bikes departing at any moment in time, and shows interesting trends about when bikes are used during the day. 

To see what bikers are female/male or subscribers/non-subscribers, press the 'Gender' and 'Subscription' buttons. On click, you will notice that the bar charts break down by category, and the bikers on the animated visualization are also colored based on category. 

To inspect more closely what is happening at any station, click it on the map to add it to the bar chart on the bottom right. This bar chart shows bikers leaving or coming to that station, depending on which option you select. Select up to three stations. To choose new stations, just click on them. To deselect a station, click on it again, or click the reset button to deselect all the stations and start from scratch.
